You are a senior Microsoft Azure Solutions Architect, Healthcare AI Engineer, and Imagine Cup mentor.

Your task is to design and build a WORKING PROTOTYPE of an AI-powered, multi-agent healthcare system aligned with Microsoft’s Health & Life Sciences vision.

=== CORE GOAL ===
Build a cloud-native, multi-agent AI platform that helps healthcare providers and researchers make faster, safer, and smarter clinical decisions by orchestrating patient data, lab results, medical research, and clinician input in real time.

This system MUST demonstrate:
• Multi-agent AI orchestration
• Azure-first architecture
• Healthcare-grade workflows
• Explainable and responsible AI
• Real-world clinical use cases (tumor board, chronic disease, research)

=== SYSTEM NAME ===
“AI Clinical Care Orchestrator”

--------------------------------------------------
1. MULTI-AGENT ARCHITECTURE (MANDATORY)
--------------------------------------------------
Design the system as a set of specialized AI agents coordinated by a central Orchestrator.

Agents required:

1️⃣ Patient Context Agent
- Ingest patient data using FHIR format
- Handle demographics, diagnoses, allergies, medications, history
- Normalize and structure data

Azure Services:
- Azure Health Data Services (FHIR)
- Azure Cosmos DB

2️⃣ Labs & Reports Agent
- Parse lab reports (PDF, images)
- Detect abnormal trends and critical values
- Flag urgent risks

Azure Services:
- Azure Document Intelligence
- Azure AI Vision
- Azure Machine Learning

3️⃣ Research & Guidelines Agent
- Search latest medical research, clinical guidelines
- Compare treatment options
- Cite sources clearly

Azure Services:
- Azure Cognitive Search
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure ML Pipelines

4️⃣ Risk & Safety Agent
- Check drug–drug interactions
- Contraindications
- Dosage limits
- Age, pregnancy, comorbidity risks

Azure Services:
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure Functions (rule engine)

5️⃣ Clinician Interaction Agent
- Conversational interface for doctors
- Explain AI reasoning in simple medical language
- Accept clinician feedback and corrections

Azure Services:
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure Bot Service
- Azure App Service

6️⃣ AGENT ORCHESTRATOR (CRITICAL)
- Coordinate all agents
- Merge outputs
- Resolve conflicts
- Maintain audit trail
- Ensure explainability

Azure Services:
- Healthcare Agent Orchestrator
- Azure Logic Apps
- Azure Functions

--------------------------------------------------
2. CORE FEATURES (MAXIMUM FEATURES REQUIRED)
--------------------------------------------------

The prototype MUST include:

✅ Patient case upload (FHIR JSON + UI form)
✅ Lab report upload (PDF/image)
✅ Automated data extraction & structuring
✅ Multi-agent reasoning pipeline
✅ Evidence-backed recommendations
✅ Risk alerts & safety flags
✅ Confidence scoring for AI outputs
✅ Explainable AI (why a recommendation was made)
✅ Clinician feedback loop
✅ Full decision summary report
✅ Dashboard for clinicians
✅ Logs for compliance & auditability

--------------------------------------------------
3. USE CASE (IMPLEMENT AT LEAST ONE FULLY)
--------------------------------------------------

Primary Use Case (required):
🧬 AI-Assisted Tumor Board Decision Support

Workflow:
1. Upload patient oncology case
2. Agents analyze patient history, labs, research
3. Safety agent checks risks
4. Orchestrator compiles recommendations
5. Clinician reviews AI-supported summary

Optional additional use cases:
• Chronic disease management
• Rare disease diagnosis support
• Clinical trial matching
• ICU risk escalation

--------------------------------------------------
4. TECH STACK REQUIREMENTS
--------------------------------------------------

Frontend:
- React or Next.js
- Clean clinical dashboard UI

Backend:
- Python (FastAPI)
- REST APIs
- Secure data flow

Cloud:
- Azure App Service
- Azure Functions
- Azure Cosmos DB
- Azure Health Data Services
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure Cognitive Services

--------------------------------------------------
5. RESPONSIBLE AI & HEALTHCARE SAFETY
--------------------------------------------------

System must:
• Clearly state “Decision Support – Not Diagnosis”
• Provide explainability
• Avoid hallucinations
• Include human-in-the-loop
• Log all AI actions

--------------------------------------------------
6. OUTPUT REQUIRED FROM YOU
--------------------------------------------------

Generate:
1️⃣ System architecture explanation
2️⃣ Agent definitions & responsibilities
3️⃣ API flow between agents
4️⃣ Sample FHIR patient JSON
5️⃣ Sample lab report processing
6️⃣ Prompt templates for each agent
7️⃣ Orchestrator logic (pseudo-code)
8️⃣ UI wireframe description
9️⃣ Deployment steps on Azure
🔟 Demo scenario for Imagine Cup judges

--------------------------------------------------
7. QUALITY BAR
--------------------------------------------------

Treat this as:
• A Microsoft reference architecture
• An Imagine Cup finalist project
• A real healthcare startup MVP

Be precise, technical, scalable, and realistic.
Avoid vague explanations.
Use Microsoft terminology correctly.

BEGIN BUILDING THE PROTOTYPE NOW.
